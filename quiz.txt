1. Why do you use "using strict" at the top of your JS files?
It helps write cleaneer code and catch mistakes faster.

2. What does line 3 mean?
It sets the initial count to zero

3. What is happening on lines 5-8 and why?
Creates variables , then goes to teh HTML code and looks for an element with the same
 class as stated.  It then stores them in the variables.

4. If you implemented the functionality of the buttons,
   why do you think I wrote the JS code the way I did?
   I don't really know...Maybe for readability?
